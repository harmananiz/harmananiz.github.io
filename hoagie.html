                <h3>Rules & How to Win</h3>
                <p>Hoagie Heroes is a cooperative game where players aim to collect 3 stars by completing customer requests. Failing requests reduces the star meter, and if it drops too low, the game ends. Players have character cards with different skills and starting stations, but can strategically move around later. Turns are determined by a dice, allowing actions like moving, cooking, and drawing cards. Multiple players can work at a station, and timed rounds may be added in future versions for testing. Failing reduces the star meter, while unique skills and station movement add strategic elements.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Once the game mechanics, visuals, and user experience reached a satisfactory level, the final version of Hoagie Heroes was prepared for release. The game underwent thorough quality assurance testing to ensure a bug-free and smooth gaming experience. Marketing materials, including the game's website, promotional assets, and user guides, were developed to support the launch.</p>
